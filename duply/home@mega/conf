# gpg encryption settings, simple settings:
#  GPG_KEY='disabled' - disables encryption alltogether
#  GPG_KEY='<key1>[,<key2>]'; GPG_PW='pass' - encrypt with keys,
#   sign if secret key of key1 is available use GPG_PW for sign & decrypt
#  Note: you can specify keys via all methods described in gpg manpage,
#        section "How to specify a user ID", escape commas (,) via backslash (\)
#        e.g. 'Mueller, Horst', 'Bernd' -> 'Mueller\, Horst, Bernd'
#        as they are used to separate the entries
#  GPG_PW='passphrase' - symmetric encryption using passphrase only
#GPG_KEY='ECA7E9D4'
#GPG_PW='_GPG_PASSWORD_'
# gpg encryption settings in detail (extended settings)
#  the above settings translate to the following more specific settings
#  GPG_KEYS_ENC='<keyid1>[,<keyid2>,...]' - list of pubkeys to encrypt to
#  GPG_KEY_SIGN='<keyid1>|disabled' - a secret key for signing
#  GPG_PW='<passphrase>' - needed for signing, decryption and symmetric
#   encryption. If you want to deliver different passphrases for e.g. 
#   several keys or symmetric encryption plus key signing you can use
#   gpg-agent. Simply make sure that GPG_AGENT_INFO is set in environment.
#   also see "A NOTE ON SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION AND SIGNING" in duplicity manpage 
# notes on en/decryption
#  private key and passphrase will only be needed for decryption or signing.
#  decryption happens on restore and incrementals (compare archdir contents).
#  for security reasons it makes sense to separate the signing key from the
#  encryption keys. https://answers.launchpad.net/duplicity/+question/107216
GPG_KEYS_ENC='ECA7E9D4'
GPG_KEY_SIGN='disabled'
# set if signing key passphrase differs from encryption (key) passphrase
